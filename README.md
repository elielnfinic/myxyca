This is a fun project that I created when we were studying Electric Circuit Analysis when we had multiple equations to solve.

The teacher, and the class appreciate the app as it helped them do analysis faster.

This project is a bit older and might need a refresh to much current stands.

I am thinking of :
<ul>
<li>adding workers</li>
<li>making it progressive</li>
<li>refreshing the interface</li>
</ul>
